I have the pleasure to announce the release of [TyXML 4.4.0](https://github.com/ocsigen/tyxml/releases/tag/4.4.0), with special Reason support!
<!--more-->

[TyXML][] is a library for building statically correct HTML and SVG documents.
TyXML provides a set of combinators which use the OCaml type system
to ensure the validity of the HTML.
TyXML is now a stable library and 
this release comes with a few newly 
supported elements and attributes (such as ARIA elements) and associated bug fixes.

However, the main novelty of this
release is a long awaited feature: the support for [Reason's JSX syntax][JSX] in the brand new `tyxml-jsx` package. When this package is loaded,
the JSX syntax is reinterpreted in term of TyXML combinators and 
HTML validity is then checked by the type system:

```ocaml
open Tyxml;
let to_reason = <a href="reasonml.github.io/"> "Reason!" </a>
let to_reason : Tyxml.Html.elt([> ([> Html_types.txt ])Html_types.a ])
```

Here the type describes that it correctly nested some text inside a `a` tag.
The [`Tyxml`][tyxmlapi] module from the `tyxml` library provides a textual output, but we
can also build DOM trees using the [`js_of_ocaml-tyxml` package][tyxmljsapi]:

```ocaml
open Js_of_ocaml_tyxml;
open Tyxml_js;

let intro = <span id="hello"> "Hello!" </span>;
let content = <> intro <Content title="the content"> ...my_long_content </Content> </>;
```

`Content` here is a custom component (i.e., a module containing a `createElement` function). The JSX syntax supports exactly the same conventions as the ReasonReact one.

We can also build [reactive web pages][tyxmljsrapi], [virtual dom][vdom], or [tierless (aka, isomorphic) web pages][Eliom], all with exactly the same API and the same typing properties. You simply need to have the `Html` and `Svg` modules in scope!
Examples are available [here][examples] and the documentation is available [here][doc].

So far, TyXML does not interact with ReasonReact in any way. However, it should 
be possible to add a TyXML API to create ReasonReact's elements. This might be 
done in a future version.

The initial implementation (and proper motivational push) was provided by
some [vocal Ahrefs programmers](https://github.com/ocsigen/tyxml/pull/247), so thanks to them and happy programming!
