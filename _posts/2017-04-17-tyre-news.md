Here are some news about [Tyre][], along with release of version 0.3.

Last summer was the first release of [Tyre][]. The original announcement can be found
[here][anntyre] (to my surprise, it even made its way into [HN's frontpage][HNtyre]).

Since then, version 0.2 was released a few month ago with a vastly improved API
, mostly thanks to the numerous remarks by [Rudi Grinberg][].
Version 0.3, released today, improves performances significantly and
introduces repeated matches with `Tyre.all` and `Tyre.all_gen`.

You can now find interesting middle-size examples in the [examples][]
and [benchmark][] directories, including an ini parser and a simplified
HTTP parser. Tyre is roughly up to 5 time faster than angstrom on this simplified HTTP parser.
A URI parser can also be found [in this prototype PR on ocaml-uri][uri].

Finally, I made a presentation in the OUPS Meetup to present regex
combinators and the type-indexed version used in tyre. The slides
are available [here][slides].

For anyone using regular expressions or parsing regular languages, tyre
can improve the safety and clarity of your code while offering very good performances. I would be very happy to get any feedback on [the bug tracker][bug].

For the future, there are several area to explore. Tyre is very suitable to being staged with metaocaml. Macros, however, [are more challenging][bugmacro].
The behavior of repeated matches in tyre could be improved, but requires better
support from re. Finally, tyre could provide a decent API for lexing. This
would however need significant improvements in re.

Happy OCaml hacking!
