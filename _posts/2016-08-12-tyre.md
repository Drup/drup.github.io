I'm happy to announce the release of [Tyre][tyre], a library for Typed Regular Expressions.
<!--more-->

Tyre is a set of combinators to build type-safe regular expressions, allowing automatic extraction and modification of matched groups.

Tyre is bi-directional: a typed regular expressions can be used for [parsing][] and [unparsing][]. It also allows [routing][], by providing a list of regexs/routes and their handlers.

Here is a small bit of code to give you a taste. Documentation is available [here][doc]. See also the [examples/][examples] directory.

```ocaml
# let dim = Tyre.( "dim:" *> int <*> "x" *> int ) ;; (* A new tyregex *)
val dim : (int * int) Tyre.t
# let dim_re = Tyre.compile dim ;; (* We compile it *)
val dim_re : (int * int) Tyre.re
# Tyre.exec dim_re "dim:3x4" ;; (* Using it for matching *)
- : (int * int, (int * int) Tyre.error) result = Result.Ok (3, 4)
# Tyre.eval dim (2, 5) ;; (* We can also use it for unparsing *)
- : string = "dim:2x5"
```

Tyre can be seen as a modern replacement of [mikmatch][]. Contrary to mikmatch, tyre doesn't use any syntax extension and instead rely on combinators. Tyre also uses [re][], which is an efficient pure OCaml regex library (which makes it also usable in JavaScript, Mirage, and other platforms).

For the most curious among you, [the implementation of Tyre][implem] is a good example of "real world" GADT usage, while still being short (500 lines) and understandable (I hope). The details might be the subject of another blog post! :)

Good OCaml hacking!
