Hi, I'm Gabriel /Drup/[^1] Radanne, I'm a phd student at University Paris Diderot, under the supervision of [Roberto Di Cosmo](http://dicosmo.org/) and [Jérôme Vouillon](http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~vouillon/).

I'm currently working on the eliom _language_ (or, more precisely, the syntax extension) and its various semantic and typing implications. More generally, my interests are towards statically typed programming languages, meta-programming, compilation and programming language design in general

I spend most of my time hacking OCaml stuff while listening to [delicate and subtle music](http://mapofmetal.com/).

If you are wondering, my avatar is a cirrate octopod (Sauroteuthis syrtensis), which is an octopus living in deep waters. The photo was taken by David Shale. I do not actually look like that.
